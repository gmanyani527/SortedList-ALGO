# SortedList-ALGO
 
This project involves implementing the SortedList class, which extends the abstract List class. The goal is to create a sorted list that dynamically maintains its elements in ascending order. The SortedList class must implement all abstract methods from the List class recursively, along with an Iterator inner class to traverse the list.
